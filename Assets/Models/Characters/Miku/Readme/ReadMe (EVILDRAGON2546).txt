EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT PROHIBITED BY THE STANDARD TDA RULES IS ALLOWED! 
TAKE DETAILS, CHANGE UNRECOGNIZABILITY, AT LEAST LICK)))!!! 
MENTIONING MY NICK IN DESCRIPTIONS IS ONLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS EASIER FOR ME TO FIND YOUR WORK AND SEE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, 
IT IS VERY INSPIRING AND HELPS ME GO FURTHER WITH A SMILE ON THE LIPS!
